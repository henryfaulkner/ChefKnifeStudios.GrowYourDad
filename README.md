# Gameplay  
The game will work much like **Downwell**. The protagonist will descend down his backyard pond looking for fishy protein and avoiding fishy dangers. If the protagonist takes too much damage, he will forgo dive-scores, and if dad goes without protein for the day, he may lose gains. The protagonist will need to decide when to call the dive over and preserve his catch.
