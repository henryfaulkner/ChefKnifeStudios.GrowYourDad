Until you look a little closer at your dad, and you recognize tragedy!!! Your dad is not jacked at all. He’s small as fuck. No bicep veins, no lat spread, no big ol’ bitties. From now on, you’ve a mission. To grow your dad…

# Gameplay  
The game will work much like **Downwell**. The protagonist will descend down his backyard pond looking for fishy protein and avoiding fishy dangers. If the protagonist takes too much damage, he will forgo dive-scores, and if dad goes without protein for the day, he may lose gains. The protagonist will need to decide when to call the dive over and preserve his catch.

# Art  
- **Dad progress drawing** will be provided by Allison, in the style of the Vitruvian man.  
- It would help if the muscles were vectorized and could continuously scale larger.  

### Enemies  
Enemies will be fish and sea obstacles:  
- Some fish types will pathfind once you have drawn their aggro.  
- Other fish types will move in a consistent pattern.
